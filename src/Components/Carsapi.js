Despite having two fewer cylinders, the pair of turbos help the V6 develop nearly 30 hp more than the V8, while torque is substantially up by almost 80 lb-ft. Thanks to forced induction, you get a lot more oomph in the low rpms as well as better fuel economy.Only this engine has been announced by Toyota's Russian division, but in some parts of the world, there should also be a 3.3-liter twin-turbodiesel. It's expected to have 305 hp (227 kW) and 516 lb-ft (700 Nm), although it’s best to wait for some of the company’s other regional branches to confirm the specifications of the new V6 oil-burner. ",

As of now, there’s more secrecy that fact, but a twin-turbo V-8 paired with a plug-in hybrid system should provide some 750 horsepower. As for an official debut, it’s slatted to be a 2023 model, so sometime in mid-to-late 2022 sounds about right. Check out the full gallery below to see the new BMW X8 for yourself. ",
